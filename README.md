### VAE for molecule synthesis

For a KL rate of 0.3 - equally trained encoder and decoder, shows a 66.41% validity on the generated molecules.

### MPNN

A Message Passing Neural Network that works by updating bond, atom, and molecule state to predict the excitation energy gap between S1 and T1 states by the molecular structure.
